* General

- [X] stop re-rendering if nothing has moved

- [ ] different colour schemes
  - [ ] logarithmic colour scale?
  - [ ] palettes
  - [ ] dynamic control

- [ ] Julia set
  - [ ] change step fn to allow starting point
  - [ ] render-julia (partial julia c) vs render-mandelbrot

** Performamce

- [ ] write to anm iterations buffer instead of directly to q/image

- [ ] successive refinement (tiles?)
  - http://mrob.com/pub/muency/successiverefinement.html
- [ ] iterative dwell limit
  - http://mrob.com/pub/muency/automaticdwelllimit.html

* Exploration ideas

- [ ] add a control for increasing/decreasing max-iterations
- [ ] switch between dwell limits when zooming?
